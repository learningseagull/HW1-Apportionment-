Purpose:
In this assignment, you will encounter a Democratic process in the United States called Apportionment. Apportionment refers to the process of dividing up
discrete (indivisible) resources among different interested parties. Every ten years, the United States apportions seats in the House of Representatives based on the population of each state.
The basic principles behind this apportionment are: (1) each representative can only represent one state, and (2) states with a higher
population should get more representatives.
Specifically, you will implement a couple of apportionment algorithms, given a list of state populations, and determine how many representatives each state should be given
